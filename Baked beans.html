    <p>Tangy, sweet, old-fashioned baked beans are made the easy way using canned beans. This is my grandma's favorite semi-homemade recipe. She makes it every Thanksgiving, and we usually end up scraping the pan clean! There are never any leftovers.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
